                            <p>The financial impact can be downright detrimental to SMBs.
                                The average cost of a data breach in North America is $117,000.

                            <p>Cybersecurity insurance helps companies recover 
                               from any sort of data loss.  Even though prices 
                               and exclusions (a risk not covered by an insurance 
                               policy) vary widely between insurers, there are 
                               still common areas that are covered with typical 
                               cybersecurity insurance requirements.  These 
                               typical requirements are ____.  According to a 
                               2017 FICO survey, 50% of US executives surveyed 
                               said their firm has no cybersecurity insurance 
                               and 27% of US executives said their firms have 
                               no plans to take out cybersecurity insurance.  
                               In todayâ€™s world, it is vital for a company to 
                               maintain strong cybersecurity insurance.
